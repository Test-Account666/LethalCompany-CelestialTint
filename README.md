# Celestial Tint
This mod adds a beautiful view when in orbit. This includes four different orbit locations.

## These mods are required to look outside: [Ship Windows](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/veri/ShipWindows/) and/or [Spaceship Doors](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Wolf11221/SpaceShipDoor/).  
  
### Some relevant notes:  
- It currently does not support modded moons. I will try to tackle this later.
- The planets are not completely lore accurate. This is not achievable right now.
