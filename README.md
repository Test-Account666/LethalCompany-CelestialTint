# Celestial Tint
This mod adds a beautiful view when in orbit. This includes four different orbit locations.  
  
**You can uninstall or disable *SpaceShipDoor* and *ShipWindows*.**

### Some relevant notes:  
- It currently does not support modded moons. I will try to tackle this later.
- The planets are not completely lore accurate. This is not achievable right now.
  
### Planned features:
- Add modded moon compatibility (planetPrefab name)
- Add support for Eclipsed weather
- Add a meteorshower event
- Add support for on-planet weather to show in orbit
- Refine Company preset
- Write Description
- Add support for other moons in orbit?
